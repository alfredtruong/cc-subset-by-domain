# Common Crawler

Super simple Python 3 functions that can scrape the Common Crawl dataset (https://github.com/jpbm/common_crawler)

Heavily inspired by the works of others, especially:

# Input:
Search domain (ex. https://www.nytimes.com/section/politics).

# Output:
List of strings containing common crawl metadata + the scraped HTML file.
